# A-Statistical-Prediction-of-the-Outcome-of-Future-Canadian-Federal-Elections

With a population of over 30 million people, Canada is one of the largest countries in the world with
a wide array of diverse and constantly evolving political beliefs among the population. As a multiple
system parliamentary democracy Canadians have many different choices of political parties to choose from
during elections with the three largest parties being the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party and the New
Democratic Party (NDP). As the attitudes that Canadians have about these different political parties is
constantly changing, the goal of this study is to use publicly sampled data and apply stratification with
census data to predict the winner of the next Canadian federal election. It is important to note that the
sampled data contains samples from a wide array of diverse Canadians from a survey taken in 2019.
It is important to analyze sampled data and to use that information to predict the outcome of the next
federal election in order to better understand the the populationâ€™s political beliefs and the political party
they support. The data allows us to also analyze the political opinions of Canadians in different regions to
understand how politically diverse or how concentrated political opinions are between different provinces.
In addition to regional and national relevance, this study also has global relevance as the data allows us to
compare our political beliefs with other countries around the world. The main goal of this study is to better
understand the political beliefs of Canadians and how they feel about different Canadian political parties.

## Central Question

By using the data from the CES survey and conducting post stratification with the census data, this study
aims to answer the question of who will be the winner of the next Canadian federal election. Since the CES
1 data took place in 2019, we hypothesize that the results of the study will mirror the outcome of the federal
election that took place in 2019. In this election the Liberal Party won the most amount of seats, securing
the position of Prime Minister, but the Conservative Party won the popular vote. Lastly, we hypothesis that
the NDP party will place third place in the results.
